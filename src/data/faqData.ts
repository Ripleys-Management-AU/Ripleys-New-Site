  {
    question: "WHO ARE OUR CLIENTS?",
    answer:
      "As Ripleys is predominantly a film and television agency we deal mainly with casting directors and production companies associated with major television networks. Check out the homepage to see who we've worked with. We also work with advertising agencies, producers, independent film makers, photographic stylists and photographic studios.",
  },
  {
    question: "DO I NEED A PORTFOLIO?",
    answer:
      "No. Portfolios are not necessary for actors and extras. Unpolished images are the best reference for Film and Television assignments. If you are being considered for work at a featured visual or lead level, clients will request you for a casting so that they may see you in person to determine your suitability for a role. Ripleys provides clients with an up-to-date and accurate photographic database.",
  },
  {
    question: "DO I NEED TRANSPORT OR A TAX FILE NUMBER?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You should have access to your own transport and a tax file number. As an agency we are NOT your employer. You are employed by the production company on each assignment. You will be required to fill in a Tax Declaration for every job. Many jobs in this industry will call you to locations that are not near public transport. It is also important to arrive 10 minutes earlier than your call time to avoid being late. Punctuality and professionalism are imperative for work on set through this agency.",
  },
  {
    question: "CAN I REGISTER WITH MORE THAN ONE AGENCY?",
    answer:
      "No. Registering with more than one agency at a time causes confusion with the clients. Ripleys represents talent each year on the understanding that they are not currently listed with any other agency. Any talent who does not disclose multiple representation will be immediately terminated from Ripleys Management books.",
  },
  {
    question: "IMPORTANT INFORMATION",
    answer:
      "The film, television and modelling industry is an unpredictable and highly competitive industry. It is important to remember that all agency work is casual and that no agency can guarantee work. Clients choose talent for work assignments from our photos, agency submissions and from this website. Clients reserve the right to choose talent at their own discretion.",
